# HER2-Mutations-BreastCancer
Project with Samuel Tsang on HER2 mutations and drug response in breast cancer. 

# Mining HER2 Mutations in Breast Cancer
Collects ERBB2 (HER2) point and in/del mutations from cBioPortal (across 13 breast patient cohorts) for investigation of mutational functional impact. 

# HER2 Mutant Drug Screen
We screen each invidual HER2 mutant's functional role in breast cancer cells using Samuel's novel functional imaging platform. This platform consists of a suite of pathway reporter assays that indicate pathway signaling; time-series imaging is used to quantify the reporter signal.

# Validation

# HER2 Co-Expressed and Co-Amplified Genes
For all HER2 patients, we stratify patients according to overall survival (+/- 3 years). We then assess over-expressed and amplified genes in the short survival group (compared to the long survival group) to come up with our list of candidate resistance drivers. These genes are then over-expressed/ amplified in the screening system and also undergo pathway reporter activity.
