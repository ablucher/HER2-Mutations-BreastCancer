# HER2-Mutations-BreastCancer
Circle of Giving HER2 Drug Screen with Samuel Tsang on HER2 mutations and drug response in breast cancer. Prioritizes breast cancer HER2 alterations of interest for drug screen using Samuel's translocation reporter / functional imaging platform.

# Aim 1. HER2 Mutant Drug Screen
Collects ERBB2 (HER2) point and in/del mutations from cBioPortal (across 13 breast patient cohorts) for investigation of mutational functional impact. 

We screen each individual HER2 mutant's functional role in breast cancer cells using Samuel's novel pathway reporter/ functional imaging platform. This platform consists of a suite of pathway reporter assays that indicate pathway signaling; time-series imaging is used to quantify the reporter signal.

# Aim 2. Candidate Resistance Driver Genes in HER2 Breast Cancer
Collects ERBB (HER2) patients from TCGA BRCA with available survival data. Stratifies cohort into short and long survival groups and assesses differentially expressed genes between the two groups.

# HER2 Co-Expressed and Co-Amplified Genes
For all HER2 patients, we stratify patients according to overall survival (+/- 3 years). We then assess over-expressed and amplified genes in the short survival group (compared to the long survival group) to come up with our list of candidate resistance drivers. The driver genes are screened using the pathway reporter/functional imaging platform.
